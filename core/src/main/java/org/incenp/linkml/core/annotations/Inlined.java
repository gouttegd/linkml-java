/**
 * An annotation to indicate whether the value(s) of a field should be inlined
 * or not (in serialisations that do support inlining).
 * <p>
 * When that annotation is not present and the type (“range”, in LinkML
 * parlance) of a field is a class that defines an {@link Identifier} slot, then
 * only the identifier is serialised (it is assumed that the full value will be
 * serialised in inline form elsewhere).
 * <p>
 * When that annotation is present, the slot is expected to be serialised as a
 * dict by default, unless the <code>asList</code> optional parameter is set to
 * <code>true</code>.
